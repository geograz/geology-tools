# geology-tools

I create these tools mainly as an aid for my private and academic work. Any improvements, either new ideas for the tools, or for the code itself are highly welcome!

The tools can be used for post-processing and visualization of structural geological field work ("stereonet.py" & "mean orientation calculator.py") or should help with drawing cross sections ("apparent dip calculator.py").

All of these codes are in the works and no guaranty is given on their flawless functionality!
