handy tools for structural geological work

I have just started programming with Python and I try learn by doing, so I'm programming as much tools as possible.
The tools are mostly for post processing of structural geological field work and should help with drawing cross sections etc...
Any improvements, either new ideas for the tools, or for the code itself are highly welcome!
