# geology-tools

This repository contains some tools I created as an aid for my academic and professional work in geology and geotechnics. Some codes are rather old, but still come in handy from time to time. Any improvements, either new ideas for the tools, or for the code itself are highly welcome!

Structural geology:
- apparent dip calculator.py
- mean orientation calculator.py
- stereonet.py

Uncertainty estimation:
- distance_to_well.py

Rockmass strength:
- RM_main.py
- RM_lib.py

No guaranty is given on the flawless functionality of the codes and the repository is licensed under the "MIT license".
